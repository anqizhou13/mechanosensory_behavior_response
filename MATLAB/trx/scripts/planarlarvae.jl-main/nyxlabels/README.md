# nyxlabels

This Matlab toolbox features tools for manipulating *json* labels files and exporting parts of their content in *trx.mat* files as generated by JBM's tagging pipeline.

Tested with Matlab R2020a.

See file `update_trx_with_labels.m`.

## Note about Octave

Octave does not support *v7.3* *.mat* files, and therefore cannot read or write *trx.mat* files.
